# **The Rise of the Internet of Value**

## Overview and Origin 
---
**Ripple** is a financial technology company that was founded in 2012 by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen. The company’s founders and network architects, David Schwartz, Ryan Fugger, and Arthur Britto, constructed a system that *“enables financial institutions to send money across borders, instantly, reliably, and for fractions of a penny."*

*-Ripple*

The original idea for the company dates back to 2004 when Ryan Fugger devised a credit network called Ripplepay. This concept would later transform into a payment network called Ripplenet.

The company is funded through a variety of sources, the first being venture capital. Since its founding, early-stage investors have contributed an estimated $287 million in funding. Ripple also earns revenue from its product licensing fees and can raise capital via the sale of its cryptocurrency holdings.


## Business Activities

According to Ripple:

 *"Today’s global payments system is neither global or a system. A system, defined as a set of connected things forming a complex whole, does not describe the currently siloed payments networks that lack effective inter-connectivity to deliver on the demands of today’s customers. As for its global reach, due to the high costs and inefficiencies of cross-border payments, many banks, businesses and consumers are shut out of the current system. The litany of pain points -- low speed, limited transparency and high cost -- from the current system stem from the lack of a single, global payments network. The fragmentation of existing networks has significant downstream impact; primarily, it results in a marginal experience for all parties involved in cross-border payments. Without direct connectivity between transacting parties, factors such as traceability and timing are a black box to sending and receiving banks, businesses and consumers. Because of the high processing costs from one network to the next that are passed down to end users, it limits banks’ addressable market and impacts their servicing capabilities. The lack of standardization across networks impacts functionalities such as data transfer -- making it unreliable for end users to send critical information with their transaction."*

B2B payments drive a significant amount of volume in the cross-border payments space. As a result, Ripple’s primary customers are banks and financial institutions around the world, like Santander and MoneyGram. These organizations comprise a massive market, and according to eServGlobal's 2018 Cross-Border Payments Landscape report:

*"Cross-border payments is a US$22 trillion market, and the size of this market continues to grow, fueled by increasing international commerce, migration and changing economic trends."*

To address the needs of the expanding payments landscape Ripple is leveraging technologies like distributed ledgers, cryptocurrency, and APIs. These innovations enable Ripple to offer impactful solutions and a unique product mix:

* **Messenger:** an API-based messaging module that enables bidirectional communication between connected RippleNet banks. It connects to the beneficiary bank’s instance of Messenger to exchange KYC and risk information, fees, FX rates (if applicable), payment details and expected time of funds delivery. It packages this information and presents the entire cost structure to the originating bank, providing unprecedented visibility into the total cost of the transaction. If information is incorrect or missing, transacting parties will find out before initiating the transaction, drastically increasing straight through processing (STP) rates. Once the sender approves the transaction, Messenger employs ILP to settle funds and notifies all parties of the transaction confirmation.

* **Validator:** Validator is a component that cryptographically confirms the success or failure of a payment. It coordinates the funds movement across the ledgers of transacting parties in a way that removes all settlement risk and minimizes delays in settlement. Validator provides the single source of truth for the transacting counterparties regarding the success or failure of a payment.

* **Real Time Settlement:** "Ripple offers a global real-time payment system that enables banks and financial institutions around the world to directly transact with each other without the need for a central correspondent

* **ILP Ledger:** ILP Ledger enables transacting parties to settle funds atomically, which means the entire transaction settles instantly or not at all -- no matter how many parties are involved. The ability to atomically settle enables new, low-value offerings through the ability to send real-time payments as the settlement of funds happens in milliseconds. Further, the settlement risk is eliminated because the payment processes entirely or fails upfront. ILP Ledger is designed to provide transacting banks with 24/7, on-demand availability. The combination of these capabilities allows banks to profitably offer low-value, on-demand international payments products and services."

## Landscape
---
While Ripple has gained significant traction over the last several years, it is one of several companies competing with the Payments, Blockchain & Cryptocurrency industries. Other notable organizations within the same financial domains are Swift, Visa, & Transferwise. Over the last 5-10 years, these institutions have been impacted by major trends and innovations such as the use of mobile apps, blockchain integration, and the development of digital platforms.

## Results 
---
Despite being a relatively young company Ripple's impact within the industry is noteworthy. Its revolutionary solutions have lowered costs, increased transparency, and compelled its competitors to innovate. 

According to Ripple:
 *"With xCurrent’s bidirectional messaging, banks can more efficiently exchange information regarding the sender, receiver, fees, rates, delivery estimate and payment status to lower their operational cost of processing international payments. Payment processing costs are significantly reduced through xCurrent’s ability to increase STP rates and eliminate SWIFT fees.Treasury operations costs are decreased by lowering in-flight capital requirements, liquidity costs, counterparty risk and compliance costs. Reconciliation costs are reduced due to xCurrent’s ability to provide instant confirmation and real-time liquidity monitoring."* 

 *-Ripple*

In addition to cost savings, some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success are the amount of daily money transfer volume, the total quantity of customer acquisitions & partnerships, and the number of markets that their payment platforms service. Based on these KPIs, Ripple is performing well and has the potential to acquire more market share from some of its legacy competitors.   

## Recommendations
---

As Ripple marches forward with its current solutions, it should continue to explore new products and services like network validator rewards, a decentralized asset exchange, and a network transaction fee tracker. These features would benefit the company by increasing liquidity on its payments network and allow for greater price transparency, which would thereby attract more customers.

* **Liquidity pool staking / UNL trusted validator rewards** - provides validator operators incentives to maintain the network and increase the amount of liquidity available to Ripplenet users.

* **Fully Operational Decentralized Asset Exchange** - 
 enables users to leverage Ripple's Interledger protocol, a blockchain of blockchains, which is currency agnostic, provides instant settlement features, and secure transactions for all asset types.

* **Ledger Transaction Fee Tracker** - analyzes transaction costs, informs network participants of network capacity, and increases transparency. 


These additional products and services would utilize blockchain, Machine learning, and APIs, which would are a natural fit for the company, given that it is already using these technologies to build the Internet of Value.


*"This unification of the underlying infrastructure that ties institutions and providers together not only helps our customers grow their business but also it helps enable the world to move money like information moves today"*
